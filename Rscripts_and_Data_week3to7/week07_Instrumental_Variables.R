# Analysis of wage data

# In this section, we examine the dataset used by Angrist and Krueger in
# their famous paper that uses quarter of birth as an instrument to
# measure returns to education.

#Load the data and examine it
library(foreign)
Q_full = read.dta("QOB_full.dta")

# Observe that the variables have uninformative names
names(Q_full)

# Pull out key variables and rename according to instructions at
# http://economics.mit.edu/faculty/angrist/data1/data/angkru1991
Q = Q_full[, c(1,2,4,5,6,9,10,11,12,13,16,18,19,20,21,24,25,27)]
names(Q) = c("age", "ageq", "educ", "enocent", "esocent", "lwklywge", 
             "married", "midatl", "mt", "neweng", "census", "qob",

# Examine year of birth variable

# Notice that some entries include century and some don't.
# we remove the century for all entries.

Q$yob2 = Q$yob %% 100
hist(Q$yob2)
# Now we have a nice smooth distribution

# Examine ageq variable - age measured at quarterly level.
# to match Angrist and Krueger, we measure ageq from 1900
# this makes the coefficients of ageq and ageq^2 different,
# thought the fitted quadratic is the same.
summary(Q$ageq)
hist(Q$ageq)
Q$ageq2= Q$ageq %% 100
summary(Q$ageq2)
hist(Q$ageq2)
# Notice that the ageq2 variable only spans two decades,
# while year of birth spans 3.
# To investigate this further, let's plot one variable against
# the other.
# If the plot command takes too long, sample a few rows of
# data as in the following:
plot(Q[sample(nrow(Q), 1000),c("yob2","ageq2")])

# To understand what's happening, I read the description of the dataset
# at http://economics.mit.edu/faculty/angrist/data1/data/angkru1991
# Data for men born in the 20's are taken from the 1970 census,
# Data for other men are taken from the 1980 census, so the men born in 
# the 20's have their age recorded 10 years earlier.


# Examine log weekly wage
summary(Q$lwklywge)
# To get a sense of scale, take the exponent of this variable
summary(exp(Q$lwklywge))
# Wages range from 10 cents to 75 thousand dollars.
hist(Q$lwklywge, breaks = 100)

# There are a few outliers on both sides of the distribution
# We can look at a few of the smallest values to get a sense of
# whether they're meaningful
head(sort(exp(Q$lwklywge)), 100)
# The lowest wage is about 10 cents an hour. We might worry if this
# is an error, but notice that the values increase fairly smoothly
# above this point.




# Let's visualize the relationship between yob and log weekly wage
by(Q$lwklywge, Q$yob2, mean)
plot( c(1920:1949), by(Q$lwklywge, Q$yob2, mean), xlab = "Year of Birth", 
      ylab = "Log Wage")
# Notive the discontinuity at 1930.  Once again, this is because data for
# men born in the 20's comes from the 1970 census, while data for other men
# comes from the 1980 census, so these two groups are not comparable.


# In accordance with Angrist and Krueger (1991), we look at one decade
# of individuals at a time.  As the authors explain, the subset of men born
# in the 1930's is especially fruitful for study, because the average wage
# for men is roughly flat through this decade, then declines for men born
# in the 40's.

# Lets create a graph of log wages by quarter of birth, to visually
# assess whether there's a relationship.
# To do this, we examine the quarter of birth variable, to see how
# it relates to age in quarters.
summary(Q30$qob)
head(Q30[,c("ageq2","qob")], 10)
# Starting from the lowest value of ageq2, which is 40.25, quarter of
# birth is 4, 3, 2, 1, 4 and so on.

##### Instrumental Variable Estimation
# Let's begin with the simple OLS regression with no covariates
# Since ability and other variables are omitted, we expect OLS
# to provide a biased estimate of the return to education.
ols_model0 = lm(lwklywge ~ educ, data = Q30)
plot(ols_model0)
coeftest(ols_model0, vcov = vcovHC)
# In the naive regression, each year of education is associated
# with about a 7% increase in wage.

# We want to use quarter of birth as an instrument.
# Let's confirm whether it's related to education.
# We can write down the first stage regression.
first_stage = lm(educ ~ factor(qob), data = Q30)
coeftest(first_stage, vcov = vcovHC)
# There's a significant relationship: men born in the
# 4th quarter get an average of 0.15 more years of education
# than men born in the 1st quarter.

# We could do the second stage regression directly, by putting
# the fitted values from the first stage directly into our
# linear model.
# WARNING: The standard errors produced by this regression
# are invalid.
second_stage = lm(Q30$lwklywge ~ first_stage$fitted)
summary(second_stage)
# Our estimate of returns to education has slightly increased,
# to around 10% per year.

# More commonly, we will have R do both stages for us, using
# the ivreg command.
tsls_model0 = ivreg(lwklywge ~ educ | factor(qob), data = Q30)

# To test coefficients and get robust standard errors, we use
# the robust.se command.
se_tsls0 = robust.se(tsls_model0)
se_tsls0

# Notice that we can pull our the second column to get just the numeric
# vector of standard errors.  This will be useful to pass into stargazer
# for output.
se_tsls0[,2]


##### Alternate Model Specifications

##### The Wald Estimator
# Here's how we would use a Wald estimator in this setting.
# The Wald estimator requires a binary treatment variable.
# We'll use a dummy variable for being born in the first quarter.

Q30$q1 = Q30$qob == 1

# We can specifically examine the difference in wage between these groups
wage_change = by(Q30$lwklywge, Q30$q1, mean)[2] - by(Q30$lwklywge, Q30$q1, mean)[1]
wage_change

# We can also look at the difference in education levels between the groups.
educ_change = by(Q30$educ, Q30$q1, mean)[2] - by(Q30$educ, Q30$q1, mean)[1]
educ_change

# The ratio is the Wald estimator
wage_change/educ_change

# We can get the same thing by running the instrumental variable regression
# in the usual way.
# This also makes computing standard errors much easier.
wald_model = ivreg(lwklywge ~ educ | q1, data = Q30)
robust.se(wald_model)
